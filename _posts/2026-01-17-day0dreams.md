## Welcome to My Thoughts!

* **Math & Physics:** Deep dives and book reviews.
* **Computers & Engineering:** Technical hurdles and breakthroughs.
* **Data & Analytics:** Insights from the world of Data Science and Engineering.

### The "Home Server" Experiment

I originally started this website on my own [Home server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_server) . While it was a great learning experience, the maintenance became a hurdle I couldn't ignore. 

Managing a server becomes incredibly tedious when you face:
1.  **Limited Physical Access:** Hard to fix hardware issues when you're away for long stretches.
2.  **Power Constraints:** No electricity backup makes uptime a constant battle.

> A friend suggested I try github pages, and honestly, the simplicity is refreshing. It allows me to focus on writing rather than sysadmin tasks.

### My Commitment

I plan to use this blog as a digital garden to grow my ideas. Before we dive in, a quick note on professional boundaries:

**Disclaimer:**
* **Personal Views:** The opinions expressed here are strictly my own and do not represent those of my employer.
* **Data Integrity:** All data used to derive insights is sourced from my personal research and is entirely independent of my professional work.
